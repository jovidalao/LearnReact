# LearnReact: A Full-Stack Development Journey

Welcome to my LearnReact repository! This repository documents my journey through a comprehensive full-stack development learning plan, focusing on React, Next.js, and React Native. It serves as a collection of projects I'm building to master these technologies.

The structure and goals of this learning journey are outlined in the [Full-Stack learning plan.md](Full-Stack%20learning%20plan.md) file.

## Projects

This repository contains a series of projects, each in its own directory, demonstrating the skills and concepts I'm learning at each stage.

*   **calculator-app**: A simple calculator application built with React to practice fundamental concepts.
*   **e-commerce-platform**: A more complex e-commerce application to explore state management and API integration.
*   **personal-portfolio**: My personal portfolio website built with Next.js.
*   **task-management-system**: A full-stack task management system.
*   **todo-app**: A classic to-do list application.
*   **todo-app-mobile**: A mobile version of the to-do app built with React Native.
*   **weather-dashboard**: A weather application to practice working with external APIs.

## Goals

My primary goal is to follow the learning plan, build a strong portfolio of projects, and gain the skills necessary to become a proficient full-stack developer. This repository will track my progress and showcase my work.
